Order of Implementation
1.	Project Setup: Create the directory structure and add basic files (README.md, architecture.md).

2.	Core Models: Start with src/models/ to define data structures. These models are the foundation used by other modules.

3.	Price Generation: Implement src/price_generators.py. Begin with a simple generator (e.g., Random Walk) to generate test price data.

4.	Indicator Base & Implementation:
	•	Define the abstract base in src/indicators/base.py.
	•	Implement one or two indicators (e.g., SMA, MACD) in src/indicators/price_indicators.py.

5.	Utility Modules: Build src/utils/data_aggregator.py and src/utils/chart_plotting.py for handling timeframes and visualizations.

6.	Backtesting Core:
	•	Develop src/backtesting/backtesting_engine.py to process signals.
	•	Create src/backtesting/trade.py to log and simulate trades.
	•	Implement src/backtesting/performance_calculator.py for metrics.

7.	Controllers:
	•	Implement src/controllers/backtest_controller.py to tie the backtesting workflow together.
	•	Set up src/controllers/price_controller.py if it provides specialized functionality.
	•	Implement src/controllers/cli.py to manage user input/output.

8.	Main Application: Wire everything together in src/main.py. Ensure that you can start the CLI and execute a complete backtesting run.

9.	Testing & Refinement: Write tests in tests/ for each module. Refine and refactor based on feedback from tests and real usage scenarios.
