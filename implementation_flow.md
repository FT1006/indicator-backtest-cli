**Updated Order of Implementation**

1. **Project Setup:**  
   - Create the directory structure and add basic files (e.g., `README.md`, `architecture.md`).

2. **Core Models:**  
   - Develop the foundational data structures in `src/models/` (e.g., `price_data.py`, `trade.py`, `indicator_value.py`).  
   - These models will be used throughout other modules.

3. **Price Generation:**  
   - Implement `src/price_generators.py` starting with a simple generator (e.g., a Random Walk) to produce test price data.

4. **Utility Modules:**  
   - **Logging & Debugging:**  
     - Develop `src/utils/logger.py` to configure and manage logging across the application.
   - **CLI Config Loader:**  
     - Create `src/config/cli_config_loader.py` to handle command-line arguments and configuration settings.
   - **Other Utilities:**  
     - Build `src/utils/data_aggregator.py` for handling timeframes.
     - Create `src/utils/chart_plotting.py` for visualizing price data, indicator values, and trades.

5. **Indicator Base & Implementation:**  
   - Define the abstract base in `src/indicators/base.py`.
   - Implement one or two concrete indicators (e.g., SMA, MACD) in `src/indicators/price_indicators.py`.

6. **Backtesting Core:**  
   - Develop `src/backtesting/backtesting_engine.py` to process signals and drive the simulation.
   - Create `src/backtesting/trade.py` to log and simulate trades.
   - Implement `src/backtesting/performance_calculator.py` to compute performance metrics.

7. **Controllers:**  
   - Implement `src/controllers/backtest_controller.py` to tie the backtesting workflow together.
   - (If needed) Develop a specialized controller (e.g., `src/controllers/price_controller.py`) for price-related functionalities.
   - Implement `src/controllers/cli.py` to manage user input/output, leveraging the CLI Config Loader for configuration.

8. **Main Application:**  
   - Wire everything together in `src/main.py`.  
   - Ensure that the application initializes logging, loads configuration via the CLI Config Loader, and executes a complete backtesting run.

9. **Testing & Refinement:**  
   - Write unit and integration tests for each module in the `tests/` directory.
   - Refine and refactor based on feedback from tests and real usage scenarios.

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Integration of New Modules:**  
  - The **CLI Config Loader** and **Logging Tools** should be set up early (in the utility and configuration modules) so that they can be used globally from the very start (e.g., in `main.py` and across controllers).

- **Iterative Development:**  
  - While following this order, it can be beneficial to develop and test small components iteratively, ensuring that each layer (from models to the main application) works correctly before integrating the next.

This updated implementation order ensures that your project is built on a solid, well-organized foundation while incorporating essential features for configuration management and logging right from the start.
